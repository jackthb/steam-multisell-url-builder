# What the hell is this?

So I found out that all of my old Counter Strike cases shot up in price thanks to:
1. an increase in demand
2. CS2's announcement

Fortunately, Steam built something to let you sell multiple items at once. Unfortunately, it's impossible to find, so unless you want to give access to your Steam account to a random util website, you've got to build it up manually. 

Well, turns out I built this **after** selling all of my cases, so maybe it'll be of use to someone else. If I get bored, maybe I'll sync it up with the an API that reads the Steam Market. 



hhhhhhhhh
